The Sumo Logic App for Heroku is a logs only app that allows you to monitor your Heroku environment. The preconfigured dashboards present information to monitor heroku infrastructure, applications, metrics and error scenarios to ensure observability into heroku and its components.

## Log and Metric Types

Herokuâ€™s [Logplex logging service](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/logging) makes it easy to collect logs from its applications and forward them to Sumo. We use a [HTTPS log drain](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/log-drains#https-drains) to send [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5424#section-6](Syslog-formatted) messages to an HTTPS endpoint via a POST request. A Logplex POST body resembles the following:

```json title="Sample log message"
83 <40>1 2012-11-30T06:45:29+00:00 host app web.3 - State changed from starting to up
119 <40>1 2012-11-30T06:45:26+00:00 host app web.3 - Starting process with command `bundle exec rackup config.ru -p 24405
```

The Heroku Labs [https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/log-runtime-metrics](log-runtime-metrics) feature adds experimental support for enabling visibility into load and memory usage for running dynos. Runtime metrics logs have the following format:

```json title="Sample metric log message"
335 <134>1 2023-08-24T10:28:47.153192+00:00 host heroku web.1 - source=web.1 dyno=heroku.322071457.63c5abfd-838b-4e2d-bce1-ce46de280675 sample#memory_total=180.43MB sample#memory_rss=180.05MB sample#memory_cache=0.38MB sample#memory_swap=0.00MB sample#memory_pgpgin=84329pages sample#memory_pgpgout=38140pages sample#memory_quota=512.00MB

```

## Collecting Logs for Heroku

Heroku is a cloud platform that lets companies build, deliver, monitor and scale apps in 8 programming languages namely Node.js, Ruby, Python, Java, PHP, Go, Scala and Clojure.

There are two ways to send Heroku logs to Sumo:
* [Sumo Logic Add-on](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/sumologic) : The Sumo Logic Add-on can be attached to a Heroku application via the UI or the CLI. It automatically creates a Sumo Logic trial account that contains a [https logs source](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics/) on a [hosted collector](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector/).
* [HTTPS Log Drain](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/log-drains#https-drains) : A HTTPS Log Drain can be attached to a Heroku application via the CLI. It can be used to send logs to a [http logs source](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics/) for any type of Sumo Logic account as per your requirement. The Sumo Logic Add-on internally wraps this method.
