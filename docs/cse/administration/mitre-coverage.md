The MITRE Coverage page shows the [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) adversary tactics and techniques from the [Enterprise Matrix](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/) that are covered by rules in your system, based on your data sources. Not only can you filter on specific tactics and techniques to see how well you are covered for each, but you can filter on vendors and products that provide data sources so you can see the coverage they provide. This will allow you to evaluate the value of your data sources by adding or removing products from the list and seeing the impact those changes will have on coverage of attackersâ€™ tactics and techniques.

To determine your coverage, MITRE Coverage collects data from rules that have fired in the last 180 days. 

## MITRE Coverage page

To open the MITRE Coverage page, select **Content > MITRE Coverage**.

1. [**MITRE TTP**](#mitre-ttp-filter). Click to filter on MITRE tactics, techniques, and procedures. 
1. [**Vendor/Product**](#productvendor-filter). Click to filter on vendors and products that provide data sources. 
1. Additional filtering:
   * **Show Rule Count**. Shows the number of rules covering techniques in the matrix.
   * **Show Technique ID**. Shows IDs for techniques in the matrix. 
   * **Show Technique Name**. Shows the names of techniques in the matrix.
1. **Export**. Export the filtered coverage to a JSON file. The file includes a score from 0 to 3 for each tactic/technique. The higher the score, the better coverage you have: 0=None (10 or fewer rules), 1=Low (11-13 rules), 2=Medium (14-16 rules), 3=High (17 or more rules). 
1. **Theoretical Coverage**. Displays coverage for all rules and data sources in your environment if all theoretically possible data sources were in use in your environment. If this is selected, the **Vendor/Product** filter is disabled.
1. **Recent Signals**. Shows coverage for your organization based on signals received recently.<!-- What does recent mean? The last 30 days? 60 days? --> 
1. **All Detected Activity**. Shows coverage for all activity detected in the last 180 days.  
1. **Total Coverage**. Estimated coverage for all tactics/techniques in the MITRE Enterprise Matrix. 
1. **Technique Coverage**. The number of techniques covered.
1. **Sub-Technique Coverage**. The number of sub-techniques covered.
1. **Coverage Type**. Key to the coverage:
   * High (17 or more rules) 
   * Medium (14-16 rules)
   * Low (11-13 rules)
   * None (10 or fewer rules)
   * Not detectable (no rules found)
   * Filter not applied
1. **Tactics and Techniques matrix**. The tactics and techniques from the MITRE Enterprise matrix. Click a square to see the coverage you have for that technique. A panel appears showing [MITRE details](#mitre-details).

## MITRE details

When you click a square in the matrix, details about coverage for that technique display in a panel. The panel has a full description of the technique, with an assessment of your coverage (**None**, **Low**, **Medium**, and **High**). A coverage of **None** does not mean you have no coverage; it only means you might not have enough rules to adequately cover the technique.

Click **Rules** at the bottom of the panel to get links to all the rules that contribute to coverage for the technique.

## MITRE TTP filter

Use the **MITRE TTP** filter to search for specific MITRE tactics, techniques, and procedures. Used in combination with the **Product/Vendor** filter, you can see exactly which data sources provide coverage for specific TTPs.

## Product/vendor filter

Use the **Product/Vendor** filter to search for data sources in your environment to see how well they provide coverage. Filtering on specific products and vendors helps you determine which provide the best coverage. Add or remove items from the list to see how different combinations provide coverage for the specific tactics and techniques you are most concerned about.

This filter is only enabled if you first select **Recent Signals** or **All Detected Activity**.
