The MITRE Coverage page shows the [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) adversary tactics and techniques from the [Enterprise Matrix](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/) that are covered by rules in your system, based on your data sources. Not only can you filter on specific tactics and techniques to see how well you are covered, but you can filter on vendors and products that provide data sources so you can see the coverage they provide. This will allow you to evaluate the value of your data sources by adding or removing products from the list and seeing the impact those changes will have on coverage of attackersâ€™ tactics and techniques.

To determine your coverage, MITRE Coverage collects data from rules that have fired in the last 180 days. 

## MITRE Coverage page

To open the MITRE Coverage page, select **Content > MITRE Coverage**.

1. **MITRE TTP**. Click to filter on MITRE tactics, techniques, and procedures. 
1. **Vendor/Product**. Click to filter on vendors and products that provide data sources. It is only clickable if you first select **Org History** or **Crowdsourced History**.  Filtering on vendor/product allows you to evaluate the value of your data sources by adding or removing products from the list and seeing the impact those changes will have on coverage.
1. **Export JSON**. Export the filtered coverage to a JSON file. The file includes a score from 0 to 3 for each tactic/technique. The higher the score, the better coverage you have: 0=None (10 or fewer rules), 1=Low (11-13 rules), 2=Medium (14-16 rules), 3=High (17 or more rules). Note that a coverage of "None" does not mean you have no coverage, it only means you may not have enough rules to adequately cover the tactic/technique.
1. **Tactics and Techniques matrix**. The tactics and techniques from the [MITRE Enterprise matrix](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/). Click a square to see the coverage you have for that tactic/technique. A panel appears showing a full description of the tactic/technique, with an assessment of your coverage (None, Low Medium, and High) and the number of rules you have to cover it. Click **Rules** at the bottom of the panel to see and links to all the rules you have to address the tactic/technique. 
1. **All Rules & Data Sources**. Displays coverage for all rules and data sources in your environment. If this is selected, the **Vendor/Product** filter is disabled.
1. **Org History**. Shows coverage for your organization. 
1. **Crowdsourced History**. Shows coverage for a range of organizations in the Sumo Logic cloud. <!-- That description is a guess. I'm not really sure what this is. -->
1. **Coverage**. Shows a summary of your coverage.
     * **Total Coverage**. Estimated coverage for all tactics/techniques in the MITRE Enterprise Matrix. 
     * **Technique Coverage**. The number of techniques covered.
     * **Sub-Technique Coverage**. The number of sub-techniques covered.
     * **Coverage Type**. Key to the coverage:
         * High (17 or more rules) 
         * Medium (14-16 rules)
         * Low (11-13 rules)
         * None (10 or fewer rules)
         * Not detectable (no rules found)
